# VulnScan

**VulnScan** is a lightweight Python CLI tool for detecting common web application vulnerabilities, including **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)** and **SQL Injection (SQLi)**. It can scan URLs and HTML forms for potential weaknesses by injecting payloads and analyzing the response for reflections or error patterns.
